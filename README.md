## Description

The Development Portfolio is a front-end website built using React JS. It is a single page application that serves to showcase my skills as a web developer, as well as providing an about me, contact form, and resume. Though single page, the app uses React to simulate the experience of running a multi-page application.

## Installation

To view the site, visit https://jevenden.github.io/Development_Portfolio/

## Usage

When the website loads, the user is first the "About Me" page, with a short biography. Using the tabs on the nav bar allows the user to navigate to the "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume" tabs, respectively. The "Portfolio" tab loads several cards containing my previous projects, accompanied by CSS animations and clickable links to their respective repos and deployments. The "Contact" tab loads a form that the user can fill out to reach out to me, and the "Resume" tab contains a summary of my work experience and a link to download my resume.

## Features

-Responsive design that mimics a multi-page site using a single aage application
